# Contributing to learnlib.github.io

Thank you for wanting to contribute to the [learnlib.de](https://learnlib.de) home page.

This document lists some advice that you should read and follow in order to meet the conventions of this project and allow for a smooth reviewing process of potential pull requests. 


## Naming conventions

* Please add new pages to the `pages` directory so that the generated URLs do not conflict with project-specific site deployments (such as [learnlib.github.io/alex](https://learnlib.github.io/alex), etc.).
* For the same reason, posts should declare `pages` as their first category because the categories are used in the construction of post URLs.

## Technology conventions

* Please do not include JavaScript code in any of the pages so that the generated site remains completely static. This allows us to have nice and simple privacy policy that is still fully applicable.
