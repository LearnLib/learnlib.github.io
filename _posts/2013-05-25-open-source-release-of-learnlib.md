Anybody is invited not only to use LearnLib for projects involving automata learning, but also to cooperate on further development of LearnLib, be it in terms of discussion or code contributions.

Archives with binaries and sources are available at the [Downloads](https://learnlib.de/resources/version-history/) page.
You can also head over to [LearnLibâ€™s GitHub page](https://github.com/learnlib/learnlib) to get access information for our version control system.
